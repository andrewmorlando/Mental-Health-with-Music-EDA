## Musics Effect on Mental Health
# Source
- This dataset is available on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results
# Explatory and Data Cleaning
- I originally started out with attempting using the correlation method. However, since the dataset held strings, I have to convert string types to a category using the astype method.
- I originally did some curiosity boolean masking to clean the data. Firstly I limited the data to only have 18 and up. Then I was curious of the top genres. From there I wanted to see what percentage of adults share my favorite taste in music.
# Now What?
- Due to the size of the data set being smaller than what would be recommended, and the lack of correlation between music and mental health, I decided to move on to a different dataset. In the future I would like to find or create a survey or dataset that will gather hobbies, music, interests, and other characteristics that lower peoples mental health disorders or issues.
- End goal for this would be a survey that would not only collect data but also give recommendations to the participants. For instance, "You answered that you feel an 8/10 in anxiety, did you know that people in your age group find that hiking lowers their anxiety?"
